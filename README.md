# Code repository for annotation and analysis of TEs in Vanessa butterflies

This repository contains code for TE annotation of 4 buttefly species and the subsequent analyses that have been performed.

### 01_TE_discovery_and_library_construction

De novo TE libraries for the four species were constructed independently using RepeatModeler2, version 2.0.4 for V. cardui and V. atalanta; and version 2.0.1 for V. tameamea and A. io with LTR structural module as in `repeatmodeler.sh`. MITE families were detected and added separately using MITE Tracker pipeline [`mitetracker.sh`]. MCHelper was run in automatic mode on the four TE libraries to extend fragmented consensus sequences and remove false positives based on structural criteria [`mchelper.sh`].

The resulting libraries were combined with the RepBase Arthropoda library, the Danaus plexippus TE library from Baril & Hayward, 2022 and the Leptidea sinapis library generated by Backstr√∂m lab in 2022. Satellite, tandem repeat non-coding RNA and low complexity repeat consensus sequences were removed from the standard libraries prior to that. A clustering step was produced with cd-hit-est, version 4.8.1, [`cdhit.sh`] to reduce sequence redundancy. The criteria used for collapsing two or more sequences to a single consensus were 95% identity over at least 80% of their total length. 

The collapsed (non-overlapping) versions of the annotation have been generated using `collapse_RM_annotation.py` tool from [collapse_RepeatMasker_annotaion](https://github.com/shohei-kojima/collapse_RepeatMasker_annotation).

### 02_TE_annotation

Repetitive sequences were annotated in the genomes with RepeatMasker, version 4.1.5 [`repeatmasker.sh`]. The annotation was filtered so that only the RepeatMasker hits with more than 300 of score, less than 40% divergency and more than 80 bp in length were retained in the library [`filtering_annotation.sh`].

### 03_Analyses
#### 03.1_TE_content_Figure_1
The TE composition of each genome was obtained using modified versions of `buildSummary.pl` that produce a computer readable format output. The Kimura-2-parameter (K2P) distance for each insertion was calculated using the utility calcDivergenceFromAlign.pl from RepeatMasker toolbox. All the code regarding data preprocessing for TE content analysis is located in `preprocessing.sh`. The code to generate Figure 1A is located in `TE_content_plot.R`, Figure 1B in `chromosome_masking.R` and Figure 1C in `divergence_plots.R`.
